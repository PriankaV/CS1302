This project aims to leverage Python programming to process and cleanse a data set. 
The primary objective entails working with a dataset of 300 rows and 5 columns. 
A secondary data table will be derived from the first, with a view to obtaining a 2-column table that serves as a basis for calculating various statistical parameters, including the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the data points.
Ultimately, the dataset will be divided into two subsets, namely a training set and a validation set. 
These subsets will serve as the basis for developing an appropriate regression or classification model.
